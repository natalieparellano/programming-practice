You have a cluster of computers. Each computer is connected to some number of other computers in the cluster but not necessarily all of them. Additionally each computer has some locally stored number which we'll call Value. The problem is to write an algorithm which sets the Value of the current computer and all other computers to the highest value present across the cluster (i.e. max of the Value on all computers). The algorithm will start on some arbitrary computer in the cluster, but it has been deployed to all computers within the cluster. Each computer is running a service which has an API like getValue(), setValue(), getPeers(). getPeers returns network handles for the connected computers. Your algorithm/program can also implement some simple API so it can talk across computers.

Some clarifications: the algorithm should terminate and you should be able to know when it does so. Upon termination, you are guaranteed that the present computer it was running on has obtained the highest Value across the network.
